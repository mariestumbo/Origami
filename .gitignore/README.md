# Origami

Using Autodesk 3DSMax's scripting language Maxscript this program allows the user to fold a digital plane like a sheet of paper.  
At this time the program only permits a signle fold of the plane, however further development is intended to permit multiple folds
allowing the user to construct more complex shapes, with the eventual goal of being able to intuitively create a digital piece of 
origami.
